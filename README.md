# Cardio-Good-Fitness 
Objective - Preliminary Data Analysis. Explore the dataset and practice extracting basic observations about the data. The idea is for you to get comfortable working in Python.

You are expected to do the following :

Come up with a customer profile (characteristics of a customer) of the different products
Perform uni-variate and multi-variate analyses
Generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the company in targeting new customers
Context - The data is for customers of the treadmill product(s) of a retail store called Cardio Good Fitness. It contains the following variables

Product - the model no. of the treadmill
Age - in no of years, of the customer
Gender - of the customer
Education - in no. of years, of the customer
Marital Status - of the customer
Usage - Avg. # times the customer wants to use the treadmill every week
Fitness - Self rated fitness score of the customer (5 - very fit, 1 - very unfit)
Income - of the customer
Miles- expected to run
Explore the dataset to identify differences between customers of each product. You can also explore relationships between the different attributes of customers. You can approach it from any other line of questioning that you feel could be relevant for the business.

Best Practices for Notebook : 

The notebook should be well-documented, with inline comments explaining the functionality of code and markdown cells containing comments on the observations and insights.
The notebook should be run from start to finish in a sequential manner before submission.
It is preferable to remove all warnings and errors before submission.
The notebook should be submitted as an HTML file (.html) and as a notebook file (.ipynb)
Submission Guidelines :

There are two parts to the submission: 
A well commented Jupyter notebook [format - .ipynb]
File converted to HTML format 
Any assignment found copied/ plagiarized with other groups will not be graded and awarded zero marks
Please ensure timely submission as any submission post-deadline will not be accepted for evaluation
Submission will not be evaluated if,
it is submitted post-deadline, or,
more than 2 files are submitted.
